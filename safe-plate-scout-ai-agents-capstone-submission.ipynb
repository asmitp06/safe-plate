    "# 🥗 Safe-Plate Scout: The Forensic Dietary Concierge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capstone Submission for Google AI Agents Intensive 2025**\n",
    "**Track:** Concierge Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 The Why: Solving \"Dietary Anxiety\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 10% of the population with strict dietary needs (Celiacs, severe allergies, religious restrictions), finding food isn't just about taste—it's about safety. **Safe-Plate Scout** is a multi-agent system that acts as a forensic dietary concierge. Unlike standard search engines that prioritize popularity, this agent prioritizes **safety verification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a \"Trust but Verify\" architecture: one agent finds the food, and a second \"Auditor\" agent aggressively checks it for safety risks based on the user's specific profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Key Agentic Features Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the following advanced agent concepts required for the capstone:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Multi-Agent System (Sequential & Hierarchical)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Concept:** We use a team of specialized agents rather than a single generalist model. A **Router** delegates tasks to specialists, and an **Auditor** reviews the work.\n",
    "  * **Implementation:**\n",
    "      * `router_agent`: Classifies intent (Restaurant vs. Grocery).\n",
    "      * `restaurant_vetter` / `grocery_vetter`: Specialists that perform the actual research.\n",
    "      * `auditor_agent`: A distinct persona that reviews the findings.\n",
    "  * **Where in Code:** Defined in `agent_engine.py` (Lines 77-133). The orchestration logic in `process_user_request` (Lines 136-193) manages the sequential hand-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Built-in Tools (Google Search Grounding)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Concept:** The agents are not limited to their training data. They access real-time information from the web to find current menus, ingredients, and allergen statements.\n",
    "  * **Implementation:** We utilize the native **Google Search Tool** provided by the Google GenAI SDK.\n",
    "  * **Where in Code:** Configured in `agent_engine.py`:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    search_tool = types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This tool is injected dynamically into the vetting agents during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Agent Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Concept:** Instead of blindly trusting the search results, we implement a self-correction/evaluation step *before* showing the user the answer.\n",
    "  * **Implementation:** The `auditor_agent` receives the raw findings from the vetter. It is instructed to act as a \"Quality Assurance Auditor,\" assigning a numerical **Safety Confidence Score (0-100)** and a \"Green/Red Light\" verdict.\n",
    "  * **Where in Code:** The `auditor_agent` definition (Lines 122-133) and the final validation step in the orchestrator (Lines 180-190).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\\. Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Concept:** We dynamically construct prompts to enforce strict constraints (Geofencing) and persona alignment.\n",
    "  * **Implementation:** The prompt template uses f-strings to inject the `Target City/Location` and strictly enforce a \"City Limits\" rule to prevent the LLM from hallucinating nearby towns as valid results.\n",
    "  * **Where in Code:** The `localized_prompt` construction in `agent_engine.py` (Lines 153-169).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\\. Agent Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Concept:** Moving from a notebook prototype to a scalable web service.\n",
    "  * **Implementation:** The agent is wrapped in a **FastAPI** backend and containerized using **Docker** for deployment on **Google Cloud Run**.\n",
    "  * **Where in Code:** `main.py` (API Server) and `Dockerfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Frontend (HTML/JS):** A responsive web interface (Tailwind CSS) that captures the user's Location, Dietary Profile, and Mission.\n",
    "2.  **Backend (FastAPI):** A Python API that handles requests and serves the agent.\n",
    "3.  **The \"Brain\" (Gemini 2.0 Flash):**\n",
    "      * **Input:** \"Find gluten-free pizza in Chicago.\"\n",
    "      * **Step 1 (Router):** Identifies intent -\\> \"RESTAURANT\".\n",
    "      * **Step 2 (Vetter):** Searches Google for 10 candidates, filters for safety evidence, and selects the Top 6.\n",
    "      * **Step 3 (Auditor):** Reviews the selected list and assigns a final Safety Score.\n",
    "      * **Output:** A structured JSON payload containing the vetted list and the auditor's scorecard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Setup & Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Python 3.10+\n",
    "  * Google Cloud API Key (Gemini)\n",
    "\n",
